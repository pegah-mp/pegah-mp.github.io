I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Mathematics department](https://science.psu.edu/math) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My PhD is under the guidance of [Prof. Xiantao Li](https://xxl12.github.io/main/), where my research focuses on **numerical analysis** of **quantum algorithms for open quantum systems**, with particular emphasis on *quantum error mitigation* and *quantum simulation*. I am particularly interested in the interplay between stochastic processes, functional inequalities, and numerical discretization in quantum evolution, and in designing algorithms that remain accurate on today’s noisy hardware. Beyond my doctoral work, I am also interested in exploring the capabilities of **large language models** in solving mathematical problems.

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en).
