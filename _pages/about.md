<h1> About </h1>

<p>
  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="https://science.psu.edu/math">Mathematics Department</a> at
  <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a>, working under the guidance of
  <a href="https://xxl12.github.io/main/">Prof. Xiantao Li</a>.
  My research lies at the intersection of <i>numerical analysis</i> and <i>quantum computing</i>,
  with a focus on developing and analyzing <i>quantum algorithms for open quantum systems</i>.
  In my recent work, I have studied <i>quantum error mitigation</i> and <i>quantum simulation</i>
  to design algorithms that remain reliable on today’s inherently noisy quantum hardware.
</p>

<p>
Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a Minot in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran. 
</p>


<h2> Research Interest</h2>

<p>
  I am boardly interested in quantum information theory and specifically how quantum systems interact with their enviroment.
  The current central theme of my work is understanding how <i>numerical methods</i> infuence and can be used to understand the evolution of open quantum systems. By blending mathematical analysis with practical algorithm design, I seek methods that are both
  theoretically sound and practically implementable.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond my doctoral research, I am also interested in exploring the capabilities of
  <i>large language models</i> in mathematics, especially their potential to assist with mathematical reasoning,
  problem-solving, and scientific discovery.
