<p>
  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="https://science.psu.edu/math">Mathematics Department</a> at
  <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a>, working under the guidance of
  <a href="https://xxl12.github.io/main/">Prof. Xiantao Li</a>.
  My research lies at the intersection of <strong>numerical analysis</strong> and <strong>quantum computing</strong>,
  with a focus on developing and analyzing <strong>quantum algorithms for open quantum systems</strong>.
  In particular, I study <strong>quantum error mitigation</strong> and <strong>quantum simulation</strong>,
  aiming to design algorithms that remain reliable on today’s inherently noisy quantum hardware.
</p>

<p>
  A central theme of my work is understanding how <strong>stochastic processes</strong>,
  <strong>functional inequalities</strong>, and <strong>numerical discretization</strong> interact in the evolution of
  quantum systems. By blending rigorous analysis with practical algorithm design, I seek methods that are both
  theoretically sound and practically implementable.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond my doctoral research, I am also keenly interested in exploring the capabilities of
  <strong>large language models</strong> in mathematics—especially their potential to assist with mathematical reasoning,
  problem-solving, and scientific discovery.

<p>
Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en).
